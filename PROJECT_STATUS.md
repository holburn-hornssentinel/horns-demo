## 🛡️ Backup Plans

### If Dashboard Fails
1. Use screenshots in `/home/horns/demo-screenshots/`
2. Show API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
3. Use pre-recorded video

### If HornsIQ Fails
1. Check Onyx connectivity: `curl http://welcometocostco:8080/health`
2. Use cached responses/screenshots
3. Switch to Teams HornsIQ demo
4. Describe functionality with examples

### If Everything Fails
1. Use screenshots + video walkthrough
2. Reschedule with apology
3. Send comprehensive documentation
4. Turn into relationship-building opportunity

**See docs/BACKUP_PLANS.md for detailed contingencies**

## 🐛 Known Issues & Mitigations

### Issue 1: Onyx Network Dependency
**Problem:** HornsIQ requires connection to welcometocostco server
**Mitigation:** Test connectivity pre-demo, have screenshot fallback

### Issue 2: Docker Build Time
**Problem:** First build takes 5-10 minutes
**Mitigation:** Build 1 hour before demo, not during

### Issue 3: Next.js Dev Mode Slowness
**Problem:** Dev mode can be slow to start
**Mitigation:** Use production build (`docker-compose up`)

### Issue 4: Port Conflicts
**Problem:** Ports 3000, 8000, 3978 may be in use
**Mitigation:** Stop conflicting services before demo
